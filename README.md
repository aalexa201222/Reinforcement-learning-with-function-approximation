# Reinforcement Learning with Function Approximation

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of an agent designed to complete an episodic Markov Decision Process (MDP) task within the gymnasium (gym) framework. The agent's objective is to navigate a small part of the UU logo, making decisions on whether to move left, right, up, or down. The learning task involves finding the goal in the center of the logo as efficiently as possible.

## Key Features
-Implementation of RL Agents: Implementation of two agents using Semi-gradient SARSA and Q-learning algorithms with a linear approximation function.
- On-policy vs. Off-policy RL: Demonstration of the differences between on-policy and off-policy Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods.
- Integration of Approximation Function: Integration of the approximation function with Tabular RL methods for enhanced learning.
- Parameter Exploration: Experimentation with parameters such as the discount factor (γ) and stepsize (α) to understand their influence on the learning procedure.
